    <p>
      The Way of Kings was my first introduction to The Stormlight Archives, and
      I have never looked back.The world is incredible the characters are
      extremely compelling, and complex while at the same time not being over
      done. The concept of the "Gods" and another world made up of concepts and
      "little gods" and their conection to the physical world is simply
      remarkable.

    <h3>Mistborn series - by Brandon Sanderson</h3>

      What I like most is how intricate the magic system is. Its almost as if
      it's a character in and of itself.The world building is phenomenal, and
      the characters equally so.

    <h3>The Dark Tower - by Steven King</h3>

    <p>
      I like this series for its dark tone, and how it ties in the authors other
      works. I find the world settings very intresting, and each major conflict
      kept me on the edg of my seat. Of course there were some decisions I
      question, but thats why it's my third pick after all.
